# MESA-pod
## A ready to go [MESA](https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa) workspace on Gitpod! 

-> In the browser’s address bar, prefix the entire URL with gitpod.io/# and press Enter. Or click [here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gautam-404/MESA-pod).

-> First Build might take some time, subsequent reboots are way quicker. 

-> To get started with gitpod, refer the [docs](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/getting-started).

### What to do once you have your workspace up and running?
* Create a directory for your work. Or clone an existing repository.
* Switch to your Folder within VScode. 
    - File -> Open -> *chose your folder in the prompt*
    - Or simply press Ctrl+O / ⌘+O to selecct your Folder
  
  With this, VScode should ssh you directly inside your folder.
* Have fun with MESA!
  - P.S. [PyMesaHandler](https://github.com/gautam-404/PyMesaHandler) is preinstalled for easy MESA access.
